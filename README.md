## ü§î Inspiration and üòñ Pain points

Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global population‚Äîbut more than 690 million people still go hungry. After steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting 8.9 percent of people globally. From 2018 to 2019, the number of undernourished people grew by 10 million, and there are nearly 60 million more undernourished people now than in 2014. One in four people in Delhi lives below the national poverty line - which is just US$50 cents per day - so many struggles to feed themselves and their families. Delhi‚Äôs vulnerability to high food prices, especially in remote mountain areas, drives hunger. Average food prices in the mountain and hill regions are over 100 percent higher than in other locations.

The inability to access sufficient amounts of food is an issue that plagues populations globally. Worldwide, about 795 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment, and about 15% of households in the U.S. lack food to some degree. Intensive farming methods use fertilizers and pesticides that contaminate streams and rivers that can create downstream ‚Äúdead zones,‚Äù and deforestation for agricultural use accounts for an estimated 10-11% of global GHG emissions. Big agribusinesses utilize poor agricultural practices to cut production costs, and, due to these practices, 5-10 million hectares of arable farmland become unusable every year, with an additional 0.3-1.5 million becoming unproductive as a result of salinization and water logging.

### üå≥ For rooftop Farming
* Rooftops farming is generally done using:
     * Hydroponics(a method of growing plants, usually crops, without soil, by using mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent).
     * Aeroponics(process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium.)
     * Green rooftops
* üí• Benefits of using Hydroponics for farming:

     * 10x Less Water
     * 10x Less Land
     * 20% Less Cost
     * 0% Artificial Fertilizers
* üí• Benefits of using Aeroponics for farming:

     * Stimulates plant growth by providing best air richenvironment.
     * Requires no special Land 
     * Requires very less water and very less water wastage.
     * 0% Artificial Fertilizers

## üåü Features of our platform
* People can rent their land and terraces for rooftop farming.
* Generating an income which may help people to cut-off some food expenses.
* Searching for the nearest location where land is available for terrace farming
